# Overview

# Required Libraries & Commands

This project relies on several external Python libraries. To ensure smooth operation and compatibility, please ensure that you have the following libraries installed. This project is tested with Python 3.8 and above.

### Libraries

- **NumPy:** For numerical computing and array operations.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn:** For making statistical graphics in Python.
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning and data processing.

### Installation

You can install all the required libraries at once using the following command:

> `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`

### Optional: Creating a Virtual Environment

Before installing these libraries, it is recommended to create a virtual environment. This keeps dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated environments for them. You can create a virtual environment and activate it using:

Create a virtual environment (replace 'myenv' with your desired environment name)

> `python -m venv myenv`

Activate the virtual environment

> - On Windows:
>   `myenv\Scripts\activate`
> - On Unix or MacOS:
>   `source myenv/bin/activate`

Now you can install the libraries within this environment

> `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`

Deactivate the virtual environment when you're done:

> `deactivate`

By following these instructions, you'll set up a Python environment with all the necessary libraries to run the project successfully.
